            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p class="child-info">
                The moka pot is a stove-top or electric coffee maker that brews coffee by passing boiling water pressurized by steam through ground coffee. Named after the Yemeni city of Mocha, it was invented by Italian engineer Alfonso Bialetti in 1933 and quickly became one of the staples of Italian culture.

            <h3>Brewing Type</h3>
            <p class="child-info"> 
                Through a pressurized system, the Moka Pot is categorized as a percolator. Through this brewing method, the coffee becomes extremely strong in flavor. Many people use the Moka Pot to simulate an at home esspresso. Coffee experts will assure you that the Moka Pot does not actually brew espresso, but just a very strong cup of coffee.
