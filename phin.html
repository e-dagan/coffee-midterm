            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p class="child-info">
                Coffee was introduced into Vietnam in 1857 by a French Catholic priest in the form of a single Coffea arabica tree. The beverage was adopted with regional variations. Because of limitations on the availability of fresh milk, as the dairy farming industry was still in its infancy, the French and Vietnamese began to use sweetened condensed milk with a dark roast coffee.

            <h3>Brewing Type</h3>
            <p class="child-info">
                While looking different in shape and form, the phin is actually similar to the French Press. Variations involve additions of ice, sugar or condensed milk. A popular variation is cà phê sữa đá (or nâu đá in the North), which is iced coffee served with sweetened condensed milk. This is done by putting two to three teaspoons or more of condensed milk into the cup prior to the drip filter process.

            <h3>Design Features</h3>
            <p class="child-info"> 
                The phin is known for its simple two or three piece design. Made from a simple metal, the phin includes the chamber, the often a cover. It's common for the phin to come in sizes ranging from a single 4oz cup to larger 12oz cups.
            </p>
            <h3>Coffee</h3>
            <p class="child-info"> 
                At its simplest, cà phê đá is made using medium to coarse ground dark roast Vietnamese-grown coffee with a small metal Vietnamese drip filter (phin cà phê). After the hot water is added, the drip filter releases drops of hot coffee slowly into a cup. This finished cup of hot coffee is then quickly poured into a glass full of ice making the finished Vietnamese iced coffee.
