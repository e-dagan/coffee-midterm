            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p class="child-info"> The V60 is a popular pour over device that usually uses a paper filter. The pour over
                can yield a very clean, light, and flavorful cup of coffee often enjoyed either hot or iced.
            </p>
            <h3>Brewing Type</h3>
            <p class="child-info">
                It may be observed, especially when using a tall, narrow carafe, that the coffee at the bottom of the
                coffeepot is stronger than that at the top. This is because less flavor is available for extraction from
                the coffee grounds as the brewing process progresses. A mathematical argument has been made that
                delivering comparable strength in two cups of coffee is nearly achieved using a Thueâ€“Morse sequence of
                pours. This analysis prompted a whimsical article in the popular press.

            </p>
            <h3>Design Features</h3>
            <p class="child-info">The V60 comes from the coffee product company Hario. There are many different designs
                of this type of coffee maker. Materials range from glass, metal, and even ceramics. Some of the brewers
                have a zig zag design. These edges can help the filter paper stay in place.</p>
            <h3>Coffee</h3>
            <p class="child-info">Brewing with a paper filter produces clear, light-bodied coffee. While free of
                sediments, such coffee is
                lacking in some of coffee's oils and essences; they have been trapped in the paper filter. Metal
                filters do not remove these components.</p>
